/**
 * \file PayloadBackendAbi.h
 *
 * C interface between libmxl and the payload storage backends that the SDK ships as separate shared libraries.
 *
 * This header is internal to the SDK. It is not installed, and applications cannot register backends. libmxl
 * only loads backends by name, from the directory that holds libmxl, so the SDK decides which backends exist
 * and every writer and reader of a flow uses the same backend code. Because the interface is internal it can
 * change between SDK releases. The version fields let libmxl reject a backend library from another release.
 *
 * A backend library is named libmxl-payload-\<name\>.so and exports one C function, named by
 * MXL_PAYLOAD_BACKEND_ENTRY_POINT, with the signature mxlGetPayloadBackendApiFn. Only C types cross the
 * interface. No C++ exception may leave a backend function.
 *
 * Options that only make sense for one kind of storage, such as a CUDA device index or a dma-heap name, are not
 * part of this interface. libmxl passes the keys of the "payload" flow option that it does not interpret itself to
 * the backend as a JSON object, and the backend validates them.
